<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<div align="center">
  <img src="imagesReadMe/Galaxy S21 Ultra.png" alt="Logo" style="display:block" width="700">

  **Greener** is a project born and developed by 3 students attending the University of Insubria.
  The idea comes from the common thought that, nowadays, there are more and more ways not to pollute or at least limit a part of it, but there are still people who, for one reason or another, find it hard to do their part.

  This is where Greener comes in! the app, with its simplicity and intuitiveness, will allow the user to use it quickly and easily. 
  But what does the app allow to do?
  * Learn (even while having fun) what the green world is: through mini-games and quizzes with a green and eco background.
  * Help you in the waste sorting! thanks to the calendar and its notifications, you will always be updated on the waste to throw away.
  * Test yourself; with its simplified Carbon Footprint, it will tell you how low or high your ecological footprint is.
  * And more (which we will let you discover..)

  Thanks to the "Leaderboard" section you can also compare your scores with all the other users who choose to become part of the "Greener" world!.
